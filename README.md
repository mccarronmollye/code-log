# Daily Code Log

Daily Code Log is a web application where you can track daily coding progress. You can keep track of what you learned, traction that's made towards goals, what you don't understand, and plan for the next day all in one place. You can then review all your code logs to reflect on the progress you have made!


## Usage

Fork and clone the repository on your local machine. Run the application by typing 'rake start'.

The home page of the app lists all existing code logs. Click 'Create New Code Log' in the form's header to create a new log.
